## Project Structure

```
/url-shortener
    /static
        index.html
    main.go
```

## Prerequisites

- Go installed on your machine
- Basic knowledge of Go, HTML, and JavaScript

## Getting Started

### Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-username/url-shortener.git
cd url-shortener
```

### Set Up the Backend

The backend is written in Go and handles URL shortening and redirection.

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
    ```sh
    cd url-shortener
    ```

2. **Run the Go server**:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

The server will start on port `5000`.

### Access the Frontend

1. **Open your web browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5000` to access the frontend.
2. **Enter a URL** in the input field and click the "Shorten URL" button.
3. **Copy the generated short URL** and use it to be redirected to the original URL.

## Project Breakdown

### Backend (`main.go`)

- **URL Struct and In-Memory Database**: Define a struct to store URL information and use a map for in-memory storage.
- **URL Shortening Function**: Use MD5 hashing to generate a short URL.
- **Create and Retrieve URL Functions**: Implement functions to create a short URL and retrieve the original URL.
- **HTTP Handlers**: Set up handlers for the root page, URL shortening, and redirection.
- **Main Function**: Start the HTTP server and serve static files.

### Frontend (`static/index.html`)

- **HTML Structure**: Provide an input form for users to enter URLs and display the shortened URLs.
- **JavaScript**: Handle form submissions, send requests to the backend, and display responses.

## Conclusion

You've now set up a simple URL shortener with a Go backend and a basic HTML frontend. Feel free to expand on this project by adding features such as persistent storage with a database, user authentication, or analytics.
